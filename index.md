# Mailio Implementation Rationale

## Mission

The goal of the MIRs project two fold: 
1. to document reasons for individual functionalities 
2. to document Mailio communication protocol 

## What is MIR?

MIR stands for Mailio Implementation Rationale. MIR is a design document providing information to Mailio Community or describing new a feature or reasons behind technology selections or it's processes and environment. MIR should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and rationale for the feature. 

## MIR Rationale

MIR is intended for MIR implementers and for collecting community technical and non-technical input on an issue. MIRs are also intended to document the design decisions that have gone into Mailio. 

MIRs are also a good way to track the progress of implementation. 

## MIR Types

Currently there are 2 types of MIRs: 
- **Core components**: open-sourced core components of the Mailio system
- **Interface**: API interface proposal and implementation details 

It is highly recommended that a single MIR contains a single key proposal or new idea. The more focued the MIR, the more successful it tends to be. 

## MIR Workflow

Before you begin writing a formal MIR, you should vet your idea. Ask the Mailio community first if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that will be rejected based on prior research. It is thus recommended to open a discussion thread on the [Mailio Discord channel Development](https://discord.gg/hXjFS2zWra) to do this.

Once the idea has been vetted by the Mailio developers, your next responsibility will be to present (by means of an MIR) the idea to the reviewers and all interested parties, invite editors, developers, and the community to give feedback on the MAilio Discord community channels.  Negative community feedback will be taken into consideration and may prevent your MIR from moving past the Draft stage.
